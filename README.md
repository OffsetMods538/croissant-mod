###### Remember [Baguette mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/baguette)? Yeah, me neither

This mod is currently a WIP so here's the current list of features:
- Croissant: Just a basic croissant. Can be thrown and does damage to entities.
- Ice Croissant: Gives slowness to hit entities and gives Frost Walker when eaten.
- Infernal Croissant: Sets hit entities on fire and gives Magma Walker (Frost walker for lava) when eaten.
- TNT Croissant: Blows hit entities up and also blows up when eaten.

Here are some of the features I have planned:
- Charged TNT Croissant
- Configuration file for configuring everything about everything.
- Advancements
- Getting a sound effect for the croissant hitting the ground.

If you have any ideas for new croissants or anything, then you can contact me on my [discord server](https://discord.offsetmonkey538.top/).
